    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic bread is a popular and flavorful side dish or appetizer characterized by slices of bread, typically baguette or French bread, generously spread with a mixture of butter, minced garlic, and often complemented with herbs like parsley.
        The bread is then toasted or baked until golden and crispy, allowing the garlic-infused butter to create a deliciously aromatic and savory experience.
        Served warm, garlic bread is a versatile accompaniment to pasta dishes, soups, or enjoyed on its own as a tasty and comforting treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baguette or French bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to around 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine softened butter with minced garlic. Optionally, add grated Parmesan and chopped parsley for extra flavor.</li> 
        <li>Cut the baguette or French bread into even slices, ensuring not to cut all the way through.</li>
        <li>Generously spread the garlic butter mixture onto each slice, making sure to cover both sides.</li>
        <li>Close the bread loaf if you had sliced through it, and wrap it in aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the wrapped bread in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the bread is heated through and the butter is melted.</li>       
        <li>For a crispy top, open the foil and broil for an additional 1-2 minutes until the top is golden brown. Keep a close eye to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the garlic bread, slice if necessary, and serve warm. Enjoy the aromatic and flavorful treat!</li>
    </ol>
