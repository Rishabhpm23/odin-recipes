    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, typically layered with a rich and savory tomato-based meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and generous amounts of melted cheese.
        The pasta layers are alternated with the sauces and sometimes include additions like ground beef, sausage, or vegetables.
        The dish is then baked until the pasta is tender and the top layer is golden and bubbly.
        Lasagna is known for its hearty and comforting flavors, making it a favorite in many households around the world.</p>
